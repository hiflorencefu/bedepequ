	<p><b><a href="">bedepequ.online</a></b></p>
	<p>bedepequ is a concrete poem made by reinhard döhl in 1967. in its original format — spiral bound, offset pressed paper boards — the triangular configurations of text move, flip, and rotate as the reader turns each page. the form of the book naturally informs a linear animation and narrative. the form of the geometric sans creates a playful disorientation.</p>
	<p>this site re-interprets how the poem would live online. beginning with the same graphic formation as döhl does, bedepequ.online preserves the animated logic of the work, but randomly generates its own path with each visit. without a final page, the work ends when you leave.</p>
